            <div class="box02">Malcolm James McCormick was born on January 19, 1992, in Point Breeze, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Karen Meyers, a photographer, and Mark McCormick, an architect, and had an older brother, Miller. While he and his brother were raised Jewish, he attended a Catholic grade school to ensure a good education and a chance to play football and lacrosse. He later went to Winchester Thurston School, and graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School.
	        <br><br>A self-taught musician, Miller played piano, guitar, drums, and bass by the age of six. He first started rapping at the age of fourteen. Before that, he wanted to be a singer. In high school, he decided to focus on his hip hop career. He originally went by the name Easy Mac and released the mixtape “But My Mackin’ Ain’t Easy” in 2007 at the age of fifteen. By 2009, he established himself as Mac Miller, and released two mixtapes: “The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown” and “The High Life”. Miller signed with the independent label Rostrum Records in July 2010, in the lead-up to his mixtape K.I.D.S.

Miller released his fifth mixtape, Best Day Ever, in March 2011. <br><br>Miller’s debut studio album, “Blue Slide Park”, released on November 8, 2011. On March 23, 2012, Miller released his seventh mixtape, “Macadelic”. Miller parted ways with Rostrum Records when his contract expired in January 2014. On May 11, 2014, Miller independently released his tenth solo mixtape, Faces. In October 2014, Miller signed a recording contract and distribution deal for REMember Music with the major label Warner Bros. Records. Miller’s major label debut, “GO:OD AM”, was released on September 18, 2015. “The Divine Feminine” released on September 16, 2016.
